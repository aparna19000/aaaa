There lived s Monkey on a tree. It was a jamun tree. One day a Crocodile came near the tree and he asked the
monkey to give some food as Crocodile was very hungry.

So the money gave him jamoons to eat, Crocodile was happy to eat the fruits, so he asked the monkey
if he could visit him everyday and the monkey agreed to it.
